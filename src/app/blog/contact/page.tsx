            I'm really glad you're here, that you want to know who I am. My name is Michael Inioluwa Oladele. 
            I'm a student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. I study one course like that which 
            I do not wish to disclose. And I am a writer.

            This is my office, my station. This is where I express my mind through stories, poems and other 
            nonfiction works. I also write for Awoko Insight. You can find some of my works on The Naked Convos, 
            African Writer, WRR Poetry, and some other literary platforms.

            I believe we all have stories to tell. Some lack the courage to tell their stories; some are afraid 
            of what the public will say; some believe stories are meant to live within; while some of us have 
            decided to tell our story. Nevertheless, whether we all tell our stories or not, one thing is certain: 
            We all have stories to tell. Welcome to my blog.
